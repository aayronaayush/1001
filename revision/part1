# In the kingdom of India there lived a King Named Iqbal. King Iqbal was not the richest king in the world however, he had enough riches for a king. His greatest possessions were the hundreds of towns in his jurisdictions and it was due to these towns that King Iqbal had a lot of power and control that he could be proud of. King Iqbal was loved by most of his subjects and was known to be kind hearted and one who could be easily angered and when King Iqbal was angry he would take decisions that maybe result in the outcome of the one who had angered him to be very bad.

King Iqbal had a son named Faiz. Prince Faiz was very dear to King Iqbal, this was because Prince Faiz was King Iqbal's only son. From the very beginning King Iqbal ensured that Prince Faiz lacked nothing and had all the comfort in the world and got the best things in the world. King Iqbal did this not only because he wanted to shower his son with all his love but also because Prince Faiz was deserving of this. Prince Faiz from an early age was very close to his father. He obeyed all this requests diligently and was also doing very well in his education both intellectual and also of self defense. Prince Faiz however had one weakness. He was very trusting because his father had painted the picture that everyone wishes well for him.

# The Kingdom neighbouring King Iqbals was his cousin brother King Mustapha's kingdom. King Iqbal loved King Mustapha very much, much like how one would love his own brother. King Mustapha unlike King Iqbal was very rich with treasures but did not have as many towns and in his towns as his cousin King Iqbal. By nature King Mustapha was very greedy and always wanted more and more. Because he did not have as many towns as King Iqbal he was always jealous of the immense power that King Iqbal could exercise over his kingdom.

King Iqbal was aware of King Mustapha's feelings towards him and King Mustapha also knew what King Iqbal was aware of.
One day King Iqbal was paid a visit by King Mustapha. King Mustapha had come to the Kingdom with 10 fine horses and the finest jewels from his treasury. Upon reaching the kingdom King Mustapha requested to see King Iqbal and upon learning that King Mustapha had come to visit him, King Iqbal made himself available immediately.

# King Mustapha saw King Iqbal standing in front of him with open arms to hug him to receive him. King Mustapha upon seeing him fell to his brother's feeting asking for forgiveness for his ill feelings towards King Iqbal and asked him to receive the gift of nine of the finest horses from his stable and the gift of the finest jewels from his treasury.

# King Iqbal accepts this gift and tells King Mustapha that he had forgiven him. And also explained to him that he always knew that the feelings that King Mustapha had to him were not permanent. He further goes on to say that he has always loved and appreciated him as a brother with whom he had common blood. King Iqbal points out the they have missed out on a lot due to this and that he would really like it if King Mustapha would stay at his palace for a week or two so that can be catch up on all that things that they have missed out on and all that they done since the time they last saw each other

King Mustapha accepts this offer but says that he will stay if his nephew Prince Faiz promises that he will spend a lot of time with him so that can catch up with all that he has missed out due to foolish envy. The next few days King Mustapha and Prince Faiz would leave the palace early in the morning and could each day go to one part of the kingdom to explore it while catching up on all that they could. While exploring King Mustapha and Prince Faiz arrive at an empty ally and while the Prince was telling him the significance of the ally, King Mustapha thought that he would not get any opportunity better than this to execute his plan. King Mustapha takes his nephew's head and smashes it into the nearby wall rendering him partially but visibly unconscious. King Mustapha quickly looks for any sharp object and uses it blind Prince Faiz in one eye. King Mustapha then reveals his greater plan of taking over the kingdom after killing King Iqbal. A subject of the kingdom was passing by and heard King Mustapha reveal his plan. The subject was well versed with the layout of the kingdom and took the shortest to the Kingdom. He reached the King's palace and told the King about the impending danger. Hoping that the blow to the head and an oozing eye was enough to kill him, King Mustapha leaves for the palace to execute his plan. When King Mustapha arrives at the palace he is taken captive by King Iqbal's army and then King Iqbal enraged orders for King Mustapha's execution. Prince Faiz who went fully unconscious after hearing this uncle's plan now regains consciousness and now recalls all that happens. He assumes that by now his father must be dead and that his uncles must have taken over the kingdom. He concludes that it will be beneficial for him to leave the kingdom never to return
