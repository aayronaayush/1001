Abdukrahman renders Faiz unconscious in sleep one night and carries him to the far outskirts of the kingdom and shoves
his thumb into his eye in hopes that this would be enough to kill him. Abdukrahman leaves Faiz in the cold sand of the
desert to die and returns to the kingdom. To erase his path to the city he drags a light carpet behind him to get rid of
his foot marks as he walks. Then next morning the king called both his sons to dine together but only one of them showed
up to breakfast. Upon inquiry with his son's guard who had already been paid by Abdukrahman to tell a false tale finds
out that Faiz was in a relationship with the cook of the palace and that they had left the kingdom to start a new life
together. This enrages the king and says that it's a good thing that his son left that kingdom for if he was before him
he would have separated his head from his body.
Meanwhile Faiz gains consciousness and finds him in the middle of nowhere, in pain from his injury and unable to recall
how he arrived at that location he gets up and starts walking in a direction hoping that it would be the directions of
the kingdom.
