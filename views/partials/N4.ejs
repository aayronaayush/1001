King Mustapha politely declines and rather invites King Iqbal to return with him to this kingdom. King Mustapha further
said that King Iqbal should give him this opportunity that he can treat him well as a form of repentance for his actions
over the years. King Iqbal sees his request of King Mustapha as being sinceres and agrees to go with him to his kingdom.
Both the brothers leave on the same day.

On the way however, King Mustapha shows his true colors, and betrays his brother's trust once more. The two brothers are
riding side by side when King Mustapha kicks King Iqbal off his horse. King Iqbal crashes into the ground and King
Mustapha stops his horse, gets off and draws his sword and puts the sword's pointy sharp edge at King Iqbal's neck. King
Iqbal was very confused and enraged but could not do anything because he did not have access to his sword. King Iqbal
asked King Mustapha why he was behaving this way after asking for forgiveness.

King Mustapha then told King Iqbal his plan. King Mustapha says "You see my brother, my plan all along was to take over
your kingdom, however I knew that you were aware of my feelings towards. So I staged a fake apology to get you closer to
me and I had pre planned my word to draw you out of your kingdom to kill you. Now I will kill you and take over your
kingdom."

King Mustapha drives the swords straight into his neck, then he mounts his horse and turns to go back to King Iqbal's
Kingdom. King Mustapha calls Prince Faiz to inform him of his father's demise and tells him a fake story of how it
happened. The story he weaved said that they were ambushed by a group of thugs and they wanted to take everything they
had and that when King Iqbal tried to defend himself they attacked him and stabbed him with a dagger. Seeing this King
Mustapha said that he mounted the horse closest to him and came to tell Faiz.

Hearing this Prince Faiz broke down. King Mustapha took this opportunity to order his guard to tie Prince Faiz. Then
King Mustapha told Prince Faiz the real story. King Mustapha then made Prince Faiz witness him kill the grand vizier.
After this punches Prince Faiz and frees him to kill him. He takes out this dagger and stabs Prince Faiz in the right
eye. King Mustapha then turns around to the crowd that gathered to inform him of how he will be their new king. Prince
Fiaz takes this opportunity and kicks King Mustapha such that he falls down. All of King Mustapha's loyalâ€™s attend to
him and Prince Faiz seizes this chance to escape the palace.
