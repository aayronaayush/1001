Prince Fiaz travels long and far until he reaches a small town. There he sells off the princely jewels that he is wearing in exchange for the outfit of a dervish. He also shaves his head and eyebrows so that he may not be recognised by anyone. He asks around town and finds out from a store owner about the way to Baghdad. Of the little that he had left from the sale of this princely jewels he buys long lasting food items to last him until he reaches Baghdad. He reaches after journeying through rough terrains and extreme temperatures. He stands at the entrance of the city staring into the various marvels of the city. As he does this he is joined by another Dervish who also had a blind eye.
