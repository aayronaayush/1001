King Mustapha accepts this offer but says that he will stay if his nephew Prince Faiz promises that he will spend a lot of time with him so that can catch up with all that he has missed out due to foolish envy. The next few days King Mustapha and Prince Faiz would leave the palace early in the morning and could each day go to one part of the kingdom to explore it while catching up on all that they could. While exploring King Mustapha and Prince Faiz arrive at an empty ally and while the Prince was telling him the significance of the ally, King Mustapha thought that he would not get any opportunity better than this to execute his plan. King Mustapha takes his nephew's head and smashes it into the nearby wall rendering him partially but visibly unconscious. King Mustapha quickly looks for any sharp object and uses it blind Prince Faiz in one eye. King Mustapha then reveals his greater plan of taking over the kingdom after killing King Iqbal. A subject of the kingdom was passing by and heard King Mustapha reveal his plan. The subject was well versed with the layout of the kingdom and took the shortest to the Kingdom. He reached the King's palace and told the King about the impending danger.  Hoping that the blow to the head and an oozing eye was enough to kill him, King Mustapha leaves for the palace to execute his plan. When King Mustapha arrives at the palace he is taken captive by King Iqbal's army and then King Iqbal enraged orders for King Mustapha's execution. Prince Faiz who went fully unconscious after hearing this uncle's plan now regains consciousness and now recalls all that happens. He assumes that by now his father must be dead and that his uncles must have taken over the kingdom. He concludes that it will be beneficial for him to leave the kingdom never to return
