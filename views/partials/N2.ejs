King Iqbal was aware of King Mustapha's feelings towards him and King Mustapha also knew what King Iqbal was aware of.
One day King Iqbal was paid a visit by King Mustapha. King Mustapha had come to the Kingdom with 10 fine horses and the
finest jewels from his treasury. Upon reaching the kingdom King Mustapha requested to see King Iqbal and upon learning
that King Mustapha had come to visit him, King Iqbal made himself available immediately.

King Mustapha saw King Iqbal standing in front of him with open arms to hug him to receive him. King Mustapha upon
seeing him fell to his brother's feeting asking for forgiveness for his ill feelings towards King Iqbal and asked him to
receive the gift of nine of the finest horses from his stable and the gift of the finest jewels from his treasury.
