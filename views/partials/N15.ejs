Both Faiz and Abdukrahman know that only one of them can be the holder of the throne and decide that they should settle
among themselve about who should be the successor to the throne. They decide that they should have sword fights like
gentlemen and to keep it fair they should invite as many people as possible from their kingdom to witness the fight. The
winner of the fight after three fights shall decide the successor to the throne and the other must leave the kingdom
forever.

Both the brothers decide that this is a good way to decide who should succeed the throne. The match day arrives and the
arena is packed to the brim with spectators. The spectators were not only subjects from King Iqbal's kingdom but also
kings and princes from neighbouring kingdoms. The fight begins and the competitions are great however, Prince
Abdukrahman notices that Prince Faiz is winning. Seeing this Prince Abdukrahman started attacking the Prince Faiz close
to the chest and neck. This carries on for quite a while. Abdukrahman was aiming to stab the neck and Faiz seeing this
coming decided to duck the strike of the sword. He thought that he would be able to steer clear of the strike and the
sword would go over his head. However, Prince Faiz was a bit slow when it came to ducking and the path of the sword came
directly in his eyes and entered his eye. Prince Faizâ€™s eye starts oozing and dripping at this sight, the match is
called to an end and Prince Abdukrahman is declared as the winner. Prince Faiz is taken to the doctor so that his now
permanently damaged eye can be patched up. Upon return from the doctors, King Iqbal calls both his children and asks for
explanation. They tell him the purpose of the fight and the agreement at the outcome of the match. Prince Abdukrahman
tells his father that his strike was a mistake. The King acknowledges that because the match was a competition for the
throne and that Abdukrahman won, he would be the successor of the throne and that Faiz must honour the agreement and
leave.
