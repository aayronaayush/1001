Both the Prince's Faiz and Abdukrahman held their father King Iqbal's word to the highest standard. Their father's words
were there command. Years passed and it was finally that time when both the Prince's were mature enough to understand
the meaning and responsibility that comes with the throne. The king called both his sons to his chamber and told him
that only one of them can be the successor of the throne. The king explains them that the reason he married Abdukrahmans
mum was because he wanted a son to succeed him. He told them that he gave Abdukrahman's mum's word that should she give
him the blessing of a son, that son would be the successor of the throne. He said that, as such, Abdukrahman will be the
next king even though Faiz was older. He said that he loved them both and he would be fair to Faiz too and would make
him in charge of the 10 biggest towns in the kingdom. Faiz refused to this and said that it felt like an insult and that
he would leave the kingdom forever. These words raged King Iqbal very much and swiftly took out his dagger and shoved
Faiz's eye with the words "If you could not see my love you are not worthy of the two eyes, and since you have already
declared you exit from the kingdom you must leave immediately".
