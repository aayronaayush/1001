King Mustapha hearing this was overjoyed. He told the King Iqbal's grand vizier that he would kill King Iqbal upon his arrival and will be the new king of what is currently King Iqbal's Kingdom. He said that he was very very pleased with the grand vizier and that he would give King Iqbal's palace to him as a gift should he help out.

The grand vizier became much more interested upon hearing this and said with the greatest enthusiasm "Yes your majesty I will most certainly help you out!". King Mustapha orders him to go back to the Kingdom and wait for the news of the passing away of the King that will come by one of my messengers in disguise. When you get this news, I want you to execute Prince Faiz. The news of King Iqbal's demise arrives in the next three days. He then goes ahead and follows the order of the King Mustapha. He takes the guards spear and pokes Prince Faiz's eye with it. "I have been ordered to take your life," says the Grand Vizier "I will however not do that for I don't want to spend a lot of time in hell. I will spare your life and in return you leave this kingdom and run far far away for if you don't I will be murdered but it won't be any better for you." Prince Faiz ponders this thought for a while and comes to a conclusion that it would be better for him to leave.
