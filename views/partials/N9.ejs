The Grand Vizier weaves a fake plot to other Vizier's that the King has gone to the King Mustapha to ask for financial
help since the kingdom is not doing well. He explains to them that they must trust his word because he is the grand
vizier he gets to go with the King to a lot of meetings and this information that he is telling them he heard during the
meeting with the Chief accountant of the kingdom. He says that the state of the kingdom is such because the king does
not know how to manage the funds and as such is not worthy of the position. He continues on to say that they must
overthrow him as the king. The Grand Vizier says that they reason he has left Prince Faiz incharge is because he is a
royal and he only wants the kingdom to operate under the eyes of a royal because he does not put enough trust in us.
