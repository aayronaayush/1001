The king married her second wife on the condition that her son would be the successor to the throne and as such the
future king. However, given that the king's first wife's son was older, she saw that the king would not hold up to his
end of the promise and would make his elder son the successor to the throne. This had always been at the back of the
second wife's head. From an early age both the boys were raised separately, they would very rarely meet each other and
when they would it would be because their father had to go an occasion with the two of them. When the king's second
wife's son was about thirteen years of age she started brainwashing him against the King, the king's first wife and the
prince Faiz, so that Prince Abdukrahman would have a lot of reason to do whatever it takes to become the king.
