King Iqbal did not know what feelings King Mustapha had towards him and as such treated King Mustapha no differently than he would have his own brother. He always treated King Mustapha with utmost respect that any Monarch deserves and held to the same standard that he would his own brother. Due to King Mustapha's feelings toward King Iqbal it had been a while since they had both seen each other. As such King Iqbal expressed his desire to go and visit his brother and made this announcement to his Viziers. He told them that he would leave after three days and asked for gifts consisting of various jewels and gold coins to be prepared to take to his cousin brother.

He announced that while he was gone he would leave his son Prince Faiz incharge of the kingdom. He said that he trusts Prince Faiz's wisdom and judgement enough to take incharge in his absence and he also said that nothing would go wrong since he would have his viziers to advise and guide him.
