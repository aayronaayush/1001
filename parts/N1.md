King Iqbal had a son named Faiz. Prince Faiz was very dear to King Iqbal, this was because Prince Faiz was King Iqbal's only son. From the very beginning King Iqbal ensured that Prince Faiz lacked nothing and had all the comfort in the world and got the best things in the world. King Iqbal did this not only because he wanted to shower his son with all his love but also because Prince Faiz was deserving of this. Prince Faiz from an early age was very close to his father. He obeyed all this requests diligently and was also doing very well in his education both intellectual and also of self defense. Prince Faiz however had one weakness. He was very trusting because his father had painted the picture that everyone wishes well for him.

The Kingdom neighbouring King Iqbals was his cousin brother King Mustapha's kingdom. King Iqbal loved King Mustapha very much, much like how one would love his own brother. King Mustapha unlike King Iqbal was very rich with treasures but did not have as many towns and in his towns as his cousin King Iqbal. By nature King Mustapha was very greedy and always wanted more and more. Because he did not have as many towns as King Iqbal he was always jealous of the immense power that King Iqbal could exercise over his kingdom.
